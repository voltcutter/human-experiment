<h2>How did I get the idea</h2>
<p>
Lol I was bored and searched up people playground but it costed like 10 dollars. I didn't have a credit card so I just made it myself.
</p>
<p>
Also because other people can play this ripoff people playground in the browser. As of right now, a lot of people play it. What I mean by a lot is like 4 people. Tes.hg
</p>

<h2>Is this a ripoff of people's playground?</h2>
<p>Definitely yes. I mean like how is it not? However there are some differences. The people look different. Also people's playground is better than this B.S. </p>
